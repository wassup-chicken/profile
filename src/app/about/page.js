                    I’m Seung — a software engineer with a strong background in backend development, and enterprise systems.<br />
                    I'm currently working on finance/accounting-related automation and SaaS integrations, and I love building tools that solve real-world workflow pain points.<br /><br />
                    I’m especially interested in: <br /><br />
                    🛠 Building backend services (Golang, Java)<br /><br />
                    🌐 Modern web apps using React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS<br /><br />
                    🤖 Automating workflows and integrating business systems<br /><br />
                    Outside of coding, I love exploring product ideas, diving into new technologies, playing soccer, and spending quality time with my wonderful wife.`}
